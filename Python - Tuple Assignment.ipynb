    "A tuple in Python is an ordered, immutable collection of elements. It is similar to a list but with a key difference: tuples cannot be modified once they are created.

    "### 1. Mutability:\n",
    "\n",
    "*List: \n",

    "\n",
    "*List: \n",

    "\n",
    "*List: \n",

    "Tuples are typically used when you want to create a collection of items that should not change. Tuples are useful for representing things like coordinates, database records, and other data where immutability is desired."
